# Put the contents of your OpenAI API key in the file identified by openai_api_key_file:
openai_api_key_file = "openai_api_key.txt"
# Or alternatively, you can comment out the openai_api_key_file line
# and instead set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to your key contents.

# Optionally, you can log all requests sent and responses received to the OpenAI API.
# Uncomment one of the following log_format lines based on your preferred format.
# log_format = "json"
# log_format = "jsoml"

# For each task:
# 1) OpenAI API request will be made if settings file provided, and/or
# 2) react command will be run on latest revisions.
