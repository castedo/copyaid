# Copy**AI**d.it: Copyedit with AI from a CLI

Copy**AI**d is an open-source command line interface (CLI) utility
that copyedits text files using the OpenAI API for

a [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
capable of frequent, rapid, and very inexpensive
[copyediting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing)
(by many orders of magnitude compared to copyediting by humans).
